# PDP-8-CPU-implementation
This is the Logisim Implementation of the CPU of PDP-8 Computer.

The PDP-8 family of minicomputers were built by Digital Equipment Corporation between 1965 and 1990, although it is worth noting that the term minicomputer first came into prominence after the machine was introduced. By late 1973, the PDP-8 family was the best-selling computer in the world, and it is likely that it was only displaced from this honour by the Apple II (which was displaced by the IBM PC). Most models of the PDP-8 set new records as the least expensive computer on the market at the time of their introduction. The PDP-8 has been described as the model-T of the computer industry because it was the first computer to be mass produced at a cost that just about anyone could afford.

METHODOLOGY FOLLOWED:
Instruction set: The original PDP-8 had the word size of 12 bits and the memory size of 4 bits with the following registers:
● PC - the program counter, 12 bits. 
● AC - the accumulator, 12 bits. 
● L - the link register, 1 bit, commonly prefixed to AC
